Two utility programs:

 - mkfs - create an empty (formatted) disk image
 - dump - show the contents of a file system disk image

On disk layout:

 - 1MB disk image file
 - 4096 byte blocks, so there are 256 blocks
 - inodes: 10 of them stored in block 0
 - An inode is free if the mode is 0
 - root directory is the 0th inode
 - blocks (pages) 1..255 are data blocks
 - root directory data block contains 10 dirents
 - A data block is free if its first byte is 0.
   - A used data block has a first byte of 1.
   - That means we only have 4095 usable bytes per block.

A freshly formatted disk comes with two files:

 - "one.txt" => "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
 - "two.txt" => "hello, two"
