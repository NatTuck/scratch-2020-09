 - Filesystem in 1MB disk image file.
 - Working with 4kB pages / blocks (256 of them).
 - page 0 is going to contain 10 inodes (240 bytes)
 - unused inodes have a mode of 0
 - inode 0 is going to be the root directory
 - Root directory contains an array of 10 dirents.
 - Dirent unused if inum == 0

Files created at format time in the root:

 - "one.txt" => "this is file #1"
 - "two.txt" => "other file"

Problem: How do we know which data blocks are available?

Bad solution: use the first byte of the data block to mark usedness.

 - Pro: Easy
 - Con: Max file size is now 4095 bytes; this breaks pretty bad
        if we want multi-block files.
