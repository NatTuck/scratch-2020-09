Median Scores on HW:

Intro:
HW1: 2/2
HW2: 2/2

KSP:
HW3: 2/2
HW4: 1/2

Gazebo:
HW5: 2/2
HW6: 1/2
HW7: 1/2
HW8: 1/2

A student who got all median grades has missed 4 points, which would be a B+ final grade.

Spoiler: I'm not going to give a median grade of B+. Mechanism: Free bonus points for everyone.

How many points? I can't know until I see project grades.


The class *is* assignments. 

Robots in two simulation environments.

# Kerbal Space Program

 - KSP kind of works as a simulation environment for teaching robot control.
 - But, covering complex topics is annoying because the world is basically static.

HW02: Launch a rocket.
HW03: Landed a rocket on the Mun.
  - Transfer: Domain knowledge can be essential.
HW04: Planning on multiple transfers.
  - Understand plan space.
  - Search that space for a good solution.
  - There isn't one well defined answer for plan space, restricted versions like 
    only Hohmann tranfers might be good enough.


# Maze Solving in Gazebo

 - Gazebo lets us simulate arbitrary academic-style robots.

HW05: Initial maze solving assignment.

HW06: Occupancy grid maps.

HW07: Did pathfinding on the map.

HW08: Camera, cheezy image processing.


# Final Project

 - Gazebo + Robot
 - Gazebo
 - KSP

# Do your TRACE evals!

Pick an appropriate text input field:

 - How did flipped lectures go?
 - What went well? Poorly?
